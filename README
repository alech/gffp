gwfp - a git-based web-application fingerprinter

Uses git to look at resources on the web, such as .js/.css/.ico/.html/.txt etc.
to figure out if those exist as static files in the git repository of open
source web application/CMS frameworks.

It then checks the timestamps on the commits on when those files were introduced
and possibly modified in the repository in order to gauge how old the installed
software is.
